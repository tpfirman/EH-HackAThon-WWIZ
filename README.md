### 💼 Mission Brief
Employment Hero’s mission is to make employment easier and more valuable for everyone. 

You’ll have 48 hours to create an AI-powered solution that reimagines any part of the work experience.

That’s it. No limits. No prescribed path. Just your creativity, speed and execution.
We’re looking for bold ideas that challenge the status quo. 
Need inspiration? Consider...
•	⚡Workflows that automate HR processes and free people for meaningful work.
•	🤖 An AI model that predicts workforce needs, boosts productivity, or detects burnout.
•	❤️‍🩹 Smart systems that enhance employee wellbeing at scale.
•	🧞 Or something so groundbreaking, we’ve never thought of it!
Big or small, if it can revolutionise work, we want to see it.


### 🧑‍⚖️ Judging Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated on:

- **Innovation** – How original and creative is your idea? Does it challenge the status quo?
- **Impact** – Can it meaningfully improve how people work?
- **AI Proficiency** – Is the AI thoughtfully applied and technically sound?
- **User Value** – Is the concept intuitive and easy to see value in?
- **Execution** – Communication & pitching skills. Can we understand what it is, why it matters, and how it works?


## My Solution

**WWIZ (Who's Who in the Zoo)**

Everyone has been in a situation at work where they were wondering **"Who do I talk to about that thing?"**, heard about a project in a meeting and thought **"Wait, what's that?"**, or seen a name on an email and wondered **"Who is that?"**. These moments of uncertainty can kill productivity and create frustration in modern workplaces.

**WWIZ is Employment Hero's intelligent workplace assistant** that eliminates these knowledge gaps by providing instant, accurate answers about your organization's people, projects, and processes.

### 🎯 Core Mission & Intelligence

WWIZ is designed to be your **go-to source for workplace knowledge**, answering the fundamental questions that drive collaboration:

- **"Who do I talk to?"** → Get the right person for any topic, with context about their role, skills, and availability
- **"What's that project?"** → Understand project status, key members, and how it relates to your work
- **"Who has the skills I need?"** → Find expertise across teams, including availability and collaboration history
- **"Who's available to help?"** → Match requests with people who have both the capability and capacity

### 🧠 How WWIZ Works

**Intelligent Data Integration:**
WWIZ aggregates information from multiple corporate systems—employee directories, project management tools, communication platforms, and calendar systems—creating a unified knowledge base that understands relationships between people, projects, and processes.

**AI-Powered Contextual Responses:**
Using AWS Bedrock Nova, WWIZ doesn't just return search results—it provides **contextual, conversational answers** that include why someone is relevant, how to contact them, and what their current availability looks like.

**Privacy-First Architecture:**
The AI Agent never has direct access to sensitive systems. Instead, scheduled data collection scripts gather, anonymize, and format information before making it available to the chat interface, ensuring **security and privacy are built-in by design**.

### 🎯 What WWIZ Can Do

- **Availability**: "Is Tim Firman available for a meeting?" → Calendar integration data
- **Skills & Expertise**: "Who has Unity experience?" → Developer skill matching
- **Project Status**: "Which projects are in production?" → Real-time project tracking

**Data Sources Integrated (426+ files):**
- 📊 Employment Hero staff records (52 employees)
- 🔍 Azure AD user profiles and roles
