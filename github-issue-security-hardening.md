# Security Hardening and Compliance Improvements

## Issue Description
Current security implementation is basic and needs enhancement for production readiness, compliance, and threat protection.

## Current Security State
âœ… **Basic Security in Place:**
- WAF with basic rules
- Security groups with restricted access
- HTTPS capability (certificate support)
- IAM roles for EC2 instances

## Security Areas Requiring Enhancement

### **1. Network Security**
- Enhanced WAF rules and rate limiting
- VPC flow logs for network monitoring
- Network segmentation improvements
- DDoS protection optimization

### **2. Access Control**
- IAM permission optimization (principle of least privilege)
- Session Manager improvements
- API access controls
- Multi-factor authentication consideration

### **3. Data Protection**
- Encryption at rest for container data
- Secrets management improvements
- Data backup and recovery procedures
- Privacy compliance measures

### **4. Compliance and Auditing**
- CloudTrail integration
- Compliance scanning automation
- Security event logging
- Audit trail improvements

## Proposed Security Enhancements

### **WAF Improvements**
```yaml
# Enhanced WAF rules
- IP reputation blocking
- Geographic restrictions
- Rate limiting per endpoint
- SQL injection protection
- XSS protection
```

### **IAM Security**
- Least privilege principle enforcement
- Regular permission audits
- Service-specific IAM roles
- Cross-service access controls

### **Monitoring and Alerting**
- Security event correlation
- Anomaly detection
- Threat intelligence integration
- Automated incident response

### **Compliance Framework**
- Security baseline documentation
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing procedures
- Compliance reporting automation

## Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Basic Hardening**
- Enhanced WAF rules
- IAM permission optimization
- Network security improvements

**Phase 2: Advanced Protection**
- Threat detection automation
- Security monitoring integration
- Incident response automation

**Phase 3: Compliance**
- Audit trail implementation
- Compliance reporting
- Regular security assessments

## Files to Create/Modify
- `infra/security/` - New directory for security configs
- `infra/security/waf-rules.yaml`
- `infra/security/iam-policies.json`
- `docs/security-guide.md`
- `docs/incident-response-security.md`
- `docs/compliance-checklist.md`

## Compliance Considerations
- GDPR (if applicable)
- SOC 2 requirements
- Industry-specific regulations
- Data residency requirements

## Priority
**High** - Essential for production deployment
