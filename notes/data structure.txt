I need a series of files to use as templates for a data structure that will be used in AnythingLLM to provide a knoweldge base for an AI Agent in a workspace.

each file type will need to be in its own object specific folder. There will need to be a template file for each object.

I am not sure what the best format is to use (json, txt, xml), so I will let you provide guidance.

The objects are as follows:
employmentHero-staff
    First name
    last name
    position title
    team
    manager
    length of service

entraAd-user
    ehsId
    first name
    last name
    email
    upn
    (anything else that could be considered useful and non-sensitive)

googleCloudIdentity-User
    ehsId
    first name
    last name
    email
    upn
    (anything else that could be considered useful and non-sensitive)

jira-userStats
    ehsId
    atlassianUserId
    displayname
    summary of projects project roles
    jira groups
    some kind of workload summary based on tickets and time entries

jira-projectSummary
    list of projects
        count of tickets by epic and status 
        list of users/groups and their roles
        project summary/details
        anything else useful

confluence-userStats
    ehsId
    atlassianUserId
    spaces active in
    total contribution summary
    summary of activity in top 10 spaces for user

confluence-spacesSummary
    list of spaces
        list of articles
        summary of article
        contributors
        activity

calendar-availabilitySummary
    ehsId
    upn
    availablity summary and working hours

teams-UserActivitySummary
    ehsId
    upn
    Active Teams groups
    Active Teams channels
    

slack-UserActivitySummary
    ehsId
    upn
    Active Teams groups
    Active Teams channels

employmentHero-staff object is the primary record record for person context. The person id from employmentHero should be used to link to all other person records.

As these will be files uploaded to build a knowledge base for an AI Agent, I want this to be as efficent as possible. Text is small, so if we can gain efficencies by repeating infomration (name, position, etc) over different files, I am happy with that. However, each object needs to stay in its own file, as different scripts will pull and parse information from different data sets.
